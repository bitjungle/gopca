**Swiss Roll Dataset Description**

The Swiss Roll dataset is a widely used synthetic benchmark for testing nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms. It consists of data points arranged on a two-dimensional manifold that is "rolled up" into three-dimensional space, forming a shape reminiscent of a Swiss roll pastry. This structure is valuable for illustrating how algorithms like Kernel PCA can unravel nonlinear relationships that linear methods cannot resolve.

In this work, a Swiss Roll dataset was generated consisting of 1,000 samples. Each sample is a point in three-dimensional space \((x, y, z)\), where the coordinates are determined by the following parametric equations:

* x​=t⋅cos(t)
* y=h
* z=t⋅sin(t)​


Here, _t_ is a randomly sampled parameter that controls the "length" along the roll, and _h_ is a random height offset (typically sampled uniformly to add thickness to the roll). This construction ensures that the data forms a continuous, twisted two-dimensional surface embedded within three dimensions.

This algorithm for generating the Swiss Roll dataset follows the method described by S. Marsland in "Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective," 2nd edition, Chapter 6 (2014).

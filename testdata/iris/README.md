# The Iris Dataset

The Iris dataset is a collection that was assembled by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher when he published the article "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" in 1936. The dataset was used as an example of linear discriminant analysis. 

The dataset includes measurements of the length and width of the sepals and petals of three different species of the Iris plant. There are 50 observations for each of the species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. So, in total, we have 150 observations, each containing four measurements.

Fisher's article was originally published in the journal Annals of Eugenics and contains discussions related to phrenology. For this reason, it is somewhat debated today.

## Corn (corn_*.csv) near-infrared (NIR) data

This dataset consists of 80 samples of corn measured on 3 different NIR spectrometers. The wavelength range is 1100-2498nm at 2 nm intervals (700 channels). The moisture, oil, protein and starch values for each of the samples is also included. A number of NBS glass standards were also measured on each instrument. The data was originally made at Cargill.

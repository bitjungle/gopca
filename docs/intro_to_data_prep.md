# Data Preparation with GoCSV Desktop: Getting Your Data Ready for Analysis

## Introduction: The Foundation of Good Analysis

Before any advanced analysis, whether it's Principal Component Analysis (PCA), machine learning, or statistical modeling, your data needs to be clean, consistent, and properly structured. Raw datasets often contain issues that can compromise or invalidate your results: missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats, irrelevant variables, and quality issues that need to be addressed.

**GoCSV Desktop** is designed as your data preparation companion, providing the essential tools to transform raw data into analysis-ready datasets. While GoCSV Desktop focuses on data cleaning and preparation, its sister application **GoPCA Desktop** (along with the pca CLI) handles the actual PCA analysis, including mathematical preprocessing steps like mean centering and scaling.

This guide covers the critical data preparation steps you should perform in GoCSV Desktop before moving to analytical tools. We'll explain not just *what* to do, but *why* each step matters, grounding our recommendations in statistical best practices from authoritative sources including Bro & Smilde (2014), Jolliffe & Cadima (2016), and others.

## 1. Understanding Your Data Structure

### The Data Matrix

Most analytical methods expect data in a standard matrix format:
- **Rows** represent samples, objects, or observations (e.g., patients, products, measurements)
- **Columns** represent variables, features, or attributes (e.g., temperature, concentration, gene expression)

> **In GoCSV Desktop:**  
> When you load a CSV file, GoCSV Desktop automatically detects the structure and provides a summary showing the number of rows (samples) and columns (variables). The Data Quality Dashboard gives you an immediate overview of your data's characteristics.

### Row Names and Sample Identifiers

Many datasets include a column of sample identifiers (IDs, names, or codes). These are crucial for tracking but typically shouldn't be included in numerical analysis.

> **Best Practice:**  
> Use GoCSV Desktop's import wizard to designate which column contains row names. This preserves sample identity while excluding these labels from numerical calculations.

## 2. Identifying and Handling Missing Data

### Why Missing Data Matters

Missing values are one of the most common data quality issues. They can arise from:
- Measurement failures or detection limits
- Data entry errors or system issues  
- Genuinely absent values (e.g., optional survey questions)

Most analytical methods, including PCA, require complete data matrices. Even a single missing value can prevent analysis or produce misleading results.

### GoCSV Desktop's Missing Data Tools

**1. Detection and Visualization**
- The Data Quality Dashboard immediately shows missing data patterns
- Column-by-column missing percentages help identify problematic variables
- Visual indicators in the data grid highlight missing cells

**2. Missing Data Strategies**

GoCSV Desktop provides several approaches for handling missing values:

- **Row Deletion**: Remove samples with any missing values
  - ✅ Simple and unbiased if data is "missing completely at random"
  - ❌ Can lose significant data if missingness is widespread
  
- **Column Deletion**: Remove variables with high missing percentages
  - ✅ Useful when certain measurements consistently fail
  - ❌ May lose important information

- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Replace missing values with column statistics
  - ✅ Preserves sample size
  - ❌ Reduces variability and can distort relationships
  
- **Forward/Backward Fill**: Use adjacent values (for sequential data)
  - ✅ Maintains continuity in ordered datasets
  - ❌ Only appropriate for data with meaningful order

- **Custom Value**: Replace with a specific value (e.g., zero, detection limit)
  - ✅ Appropriate when you know what missing represents
  - ❌ Can introduce bias if used incorrectly

> **Best Practice:**  
> Start by understanding WHY data is missing. Use the Data Quality Dashboard to examine patterns. Random missingness (MCAR) is least problematic, while systematic patterns require careful consideration.

> **Note on NIPALS:**  
> While most PCA algorithms require complete data, GoPCA Suite implements the NIPALS (Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares) algorithm which can handle some missing data scenarios without imputation. However, for best results and to use all of GoPCA Suite's features (like SVD method or Kernel PCA), it's still recommended to address missing values in GoCSV Desktop first.

## 3. Data Quality Assessment

### GoCSV Desktop's Data Quality Dashboard

Before making any changes, assess your data's current state. GoCSV Desktop's Data Quality Dashboard provides:

**Overall Metrics:**
- Data dimensions and memory usage
- Overall missing data percentage
- Number of duplicate rows
- Count of numeric vs. categorical variables

**Column-Level Analysis:**
- Statistical summaries (mean, median, std dev, quartiles)
- Distribution characteristics (skewness, kurtosis)
- Outlier detection (IQR and z-score methods)
- Unique value counts and patterns

**Quality Score:**
Each column receives a quality score (0-100) based on:
- Completeness (missing data)
- Consistency (outliers and anomalies)
- Distribution properties

> **Workflow Tip:**  
> Always run the Data Quality Dashboard first. It helps prioritize which issues to address and provides a baseline for measuring improvement.

## 4. Data Transformations in GoCSV Desktop

### Why Transform Data?

Many real-world variables don't follow ideal statistical distributions. They may be:
- **Skewed**: Long tails that can dominate analysis
- **Heteroscedastic**: Variance changes with magnitude
- **Nonlinear**: Relationships that aren't captured by linear methods
- **Different scales**: Orders of magnitude differences between variables

### Available Transformations

GoCSV Desktop's transformation dialog organizes options by purpose:

**Mathematical Transformations:**
- **Logarithm (log)**: For right-skewed data (e.g., concentrations, income)
  - Compresses large values, expands small differences
  - Only applicable to positive values
  
- **Square Root**: For count data or moderate skew
  - Gentler than log transformation
  - Stabilizes variance in Poisson-like data

- **Square**: For left-skewed data
  - Expands larger values
  - Useful for certain distribution corrections

**Scaling Transformations:**
- **Standardization (Z-score)**: Scales to mean=0, std=1
  - Centers and scales data
  - Makes variables comparable regardless of units
  - Note: For PCA, let GoPCA Suite handle this during analysis
  
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scales to a specified range
  - Default range [0, 1], but customizable
  - Preserves zero values and relationships
  - Sensitive to outliers

**Binning (Discretization):**
- Convert continuous data to categories
- Useful for creating groups or reducing noise
- Options: equal width, equal frequency, or custom bins

**Categorical Encoding:**
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creates binary columns for each category
  - Required for many ML algorithms
  - Expands dataset width significantly

> **Important Note:**  
> While GoCSV Desktop includes standardization (z-score scaling) for general data transformation, mean centering is intentionally NOT included. For PCA analysis specifically, it's recommended to let GoPCA Suite handle both centering and scaling during the analysis phase. This ensures that preprocessing is applied correctly based on your chosen PCA method and options.

## 5. Variable Selection and Column Management

### Why Variable Selection Matters

Not all variables contribute meaningful information to analysis. Including irrelevant, redundant, or noisy variables can:
- Obscure important patterns
- Increase computational burden
- Reduce interpretability
- Amplify noise in results

### Types of Problematic Variables

**1. Zero or Near-Zero Variance**
- Variables where all values are identical or nearly identical
- Cannot contribute to differentiating samples
- GoCSV Desktop's Data Quality Dashboard flags these automatically

**2. Highly Redundant Variables**
- Variables that are nearly perfect duplicates
- Common in sensor data or repeated measurements
- Can artificially inflate the importance of certain patterns

**3. Irrelevant Variables**
- ID numbers, timestamps, or metadata
- Variables unrelated to the analysis question
- Administrative or tracking fields

### Variable Selection in GoCSV Desktop

**Column Operations:**
- Remove columns permanently
- Insert new columns
- Toggle columns as target variables (#target)
- Rename columns for clarity and consistency

**Column Analysis Tools:**
- Automatic data type detection (numeric/categorical/target)
- Quality scoring for each column
- Missing value percentage tracking
- Outlier detection and reporting

> **Best Practice:**  
> Document your selection rationale. GoCSV Desktop can export a column summary report showing which variables were retained and why.

## 6. Outlier Detection and Treatment

### Understanding Outliers

Outliers are observations that deviate markedly from other data points. They can represent:
- **Errors**: Measurement mistakes, data entry errors
- **Anomalies**: Equipment malfunctions, contamination
- **Interesting cases**: Novel discoveries, extreme but valid observations

### GoCSV Desktop's Outlier Detection Methods

**1. Statistical Methods:**
- **IQR Method**: Points beyond 1.5×IQR from quartiles
  - Robust to distribution shape
  - Standard box-plot outlier definition
  
- **Z-Score Method**: Points beyond ±3 standard deviations
  - Assumes roughly normal distribution
  - More sensitive to extreme values

**2. Visual Identification:**
- Distribution histograms in Data Quality Dashboard
- Highlighted cells in the data grid
- Statistical summaries showing min/max values

### Handling Outliers

**Investigation First:**
1. Verify values aren't data entry errors
2. Check if they represent valid extreme cases
3. Consider the impact on your analysis goals

**Treatment Options:**
- **Correct**: If you can verify the true value
- **Remove**: If confirmed as errors (document this!)
- **Transform**: Apply log or root transforms to reduce impact
- **Winsorize**: Cap at a percentile (e.g., 99th)
- **Keep**: If valid and important for analysis

> **Critical Warning:**  
> Never remove outliers just because they're inconvenient. Some of the most important scientific discoveries come from investigating anomalies. Document all outlier decisions thoroughly.

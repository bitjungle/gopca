# GoPCA Suite - The Definitive Principal Component Analysis Toolset

Professional-grade PCA analysis made simple. A comprehensive suite of tools including a powerful command-line interface and intuitive desktop applications.

## What is GoPCA Suite?

GoPCA Suite is **the** go-to toolset for Principal Component Analysis, a fundamental machine learning technique for understanding complex  multivariate data. Whether you're analyzing spectroscopic data, exploring gene expression patterns, or reducing dimensionality in machine learning pipelines, GoPCA Suite provides the tools you need.

### Includes GoCSV Desktop Data Preparation Tool

GoPCA Suite includes **GoCSV Desktop**, a companion application for preparing your data. With its Excel-like interface, GoCSV Desktop makes it easy to clean, edit, and format your CSV files before PCA analysis - ensuring your data is analysis-ready.

**Key GoPCA Desktop Features:**
- Interactive visualizations with zoom, pan, and export
- Real-time plot updates as you adjust parameters
- Confidence ellipses for group visualization
- Customizable color palettes for different data types
- Light and dark themes for comfortable viewing

### The pca CLI

Ideal for automation, batch processing, and integration into data pipelines.

```bash
# Analyze your data with a single command
pca analyze --components 3 --scale standard --output-dir results/ data.csv

# Validate data before analysis
pca validate spectra.csv

# Apply a saved PCA model to new data
pca transform model.json new_data.csv

# Transform with output options
pca transform -f json -o results/ model.json new_samples.csv
```

### GoCSV Desktop

Clean and prepare your data with an intuitive spreadsheet-like interface.

## Getting Started

### GoPCA Desktop Application

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bitjungle/gopca/releases)
2. **Launch** GoPCA Desktop
3. **Try an example** - Select one of the example datasets (NIR, Iris, Wine, or Swiss roll)
4. **Or load your data** - Click "Open CSV" to load your own file
5. **Configure preprocessing** - Choose centering, scaling, and other options
6. **Click "Go PCA!"** - Explore results interactively

*[Screenshot placeholder: Step-by-step workflow visualization]*

### Data Preparation with GoCSV Desktop

1. **Launch** GoCSV Desktop from the GoPCA Suite installation folder
2. **Open** your raw CSV file or paste data from clipboard
3. **Clean** your data:
   - Remove empty rows/columns
   - Fix inconsistent headers
   - Handle missing values
   - Validate column types
   - Transform features (e.g., log, sqrt)
4. **Save** the cleaned file
5. **Open in GoPCA Desktop** with one click

### macOS Security Note

When downloading GoPCA Desktop and GoCSV Desktop from GitHub releases, macOS may apply security measures that prevent the apps from detecting each other. This happens because macOS runs downloaded apps from a temporary, randomized location (App Translocation) for security.

**Solutions:**
1. **Move both apps to Applications**: Drag both GoPCA.app and GoCSV.app to your Applications folder before launching
2. **Keep apps together**: Always keep both apps in the same folder (Applications, Downloads, or Desktop)
3. **Alternative launch method**: Right-click the app and choose "Open" instead of double-clicking

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/bitjungle/gopca/releases/latest/download/pca
chmod +x pca

# Basic analysis with automatic settings
./pca analyze mydata.csv

# Advanced analysis with custom parameters
./pca analyze \
  --components 4 \
  --scale standard \
  --preprocessing snv \
  --format json \
  --output-dir results/ \
  mydata.csv

# Validate your data first
./pca validate mydata.csv

# Apply a trained model to new samples
./pca transform trained_model.json new_samples.csv

# Transform with custom output and metrics
./pca transform \
  --format json \
  --output-dir predictions/ \
  --include-metrics \
  model.json test_data.csv
```

## Use Cases

### Chemometrics & Spectroscopy
Analyze NIR, FTIR, Raman, or UV-Vis spectroscopic data to identify chemical patterns, detect adulterants, or monitor reactions. The SNV preprocessing option is specifically designed for spectroscopic data.

### Bioinformatics
Explore gene expression, proteomics, or metabolomics data to find biological patterns, identify biomarkers, or understand disease mechanisms. Handle high-dimensional data with thousands of variables.

### Quality Control & Process Monitoring
Monitor industrial processes in real-time, detect anomalies before they become problems, and understand the relationships between process variables. Use diagnostic plots to identify out-of-specification samples.

### Data Science & Machine Learning
Reduce dimensionality before classification or regression, explore feature relationships, visualize high-dimensional clusters, or compress data while preserving variance. Export transformed data for use in other ML pipelines.

### Education & Research
Teach multivariate statistics with interactive visualizations, explore research data with publication-ready plots, or demonstrate the power of dimensionality reduction with real examples.

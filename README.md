# GoPCA Suite - The Definitive Principal Component Analysis Toolset

Professional-grade PCA analysis made simple. A comprehensive suite of tools including a powerful command-line interface and intuitive desktop applications.

## What is GoPCA Suite?

GoPCA Suite makes **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) accessible to everyone** through professional-grade, user-friendly tools that are completely free and open source. PCA is one of the most versatile and interpretable machine learning methods for understanding complex data, and GoPCA Suite removes the barriers to using it effectively. As an added benefit, all processing happens locally on your machine, ensuring your data never leaves your computer.

The suite provides three powerful tools that work together seamlessly:
- **GoPCA Desktop** - Interactive visual analysis and exploration
- **pca CLI** - Scriptable command-line interface for automation
- **GoCSV Desktop** - Data preparation with an Excel-like interface

Whether you're analyzing spectroscopic data, exploring gene expression patterns, or reducing dimensionality in machine learning pipelines, GoPCA Suite delivers enterprise-grade analysis while maintaining complete data sovereignty.

## Privacy & Security

GoPCA Suite is designed with privacy and security as fundamental principles:

### 100% Local Processing
All computations happen exclusively on your machine. There are no cloud services, external servers, or remote processing involved. Your data is processed where it lives - on your computer.

### Complete Data Sovereignty
Your data **never** leaves your computer. We don't upload, transmit, or share any of your data, results, or usage patterns. What you analyze stays with you.

### Zero Telemetry
- No usage analytics or metrics collection
- No crash reporting to external services
- No feature tracking or user behavior monitoring
- No automatic updates that phone home

### No External Dependencies
- Works completely offline - no internet connection required
- No API calls to external services
- No third-party analytics or tracking libraries
- No hidden connections or background communications

### Open Source Transparency
The entire codebase is open source and publicly auditable on GitHub. You can review every line of code to verify our privacy commitments. We believe transparency builds trust.

### Compliance Ready
Perfect for organizations with strict data governance requirements, including:
- GDPR compliance (data remains under your control)
- HIPAA environments (no data transmission risks)
- Corporate policies restricting cloud services
- Research requiring data isolation

## Getting Started

### GoPCA Desktop Application

1. **Download** the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bitjungle/gopca/releases)
2. **Launch** GoPCA Desktop
3. **Try an example** - Select one of the example datasets (NIR, Iris, Wine, or Swiss roll)
4. **Or load your data** - Click "Open CSV" to load your own file
5. **Configure preprocessing** - Choose centering, scaling, and other options
6. **Click "Go PCA!"** - Explore results interactively

*[Screenshot placeholder: Step-by-step workflow visualization]*

### Data Preparation with GoCSV Desktop

1. **Launch** GoCSV Desktop from the GoPCA Suite installation folder
2. **Open** your raw CSV file or paste data from clipboard
3. **Clean** your data:
   - Remove empty rows/columns
   - Fix inconsistent headers
   - Handle missing values
   - Validate column types
   - Transform features (e.g., log, sqrt)
4. **Save** the cleaned file
5. **Open in GoPCA Desktop** with one click

### macOS Security Note

When downloading GoPCA Desktop and GoCSV Desktop from GitHub releases, macOS may apply security measures that prevent the apps from detecting each other. This happens because macOS runs downloaded apps from a temporary, randomized location (App Translocation) for security.

**Solutions:**
1. **Move both apps to Applications**: Drag both GoPCA.app and GoCSV.app to your Applications folder before launching
2. **Keep apps together**: Always keep both apps in the same folder (Applications, Downloads, or Desktop)
3. **Alternative launch method**: Right-click the app and choose "Open" instead of double-clicking

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/bitjungle/gopca/releases/latest/download/pca
chmod +x pca

# Basic analysis with automatic settings
./pca analyze mydata.csv

# Advanced analysis with custom parameters
./pca analyze \
  --components 4 \
  --scale standard \
  --preprocessing snv \
  --format json \
  --output-dir results/ \
  mydata.csv

# Validate your data first
./pca validate mydata.csv

# Apply a trained model to new samples
./pca transform trained_model.json new_samples.csv

# Transform with custom output and metrics
./pca transform \
  --format json \
  --output-dir predictions/ \
  --include-metrics \
  model.json test_data.csv
```

## Use Cases

### Chemometrics & Spectroscopy
Analyze NIR, FTIR, Raman, or UV-Vis spectroscopic data to identify chemical patterns, detect adulterants, or monitor reactions. The SNV preprocessing option is specifically designed for spectroscopic data.

### Bioinformatics
Explore gene expression, proteomics, or metabolomics data to find biological patterns, identify biomarkers, or understand disease mechanisms. Handle high-dimensional data with thousands of variables.

### Quality Control & Process Monitoring
Monitor industrial processes in real-time, detect anomalies before they become problems, and understand the relationships between process variables. Use diagnostic plots to identify out-of-specification samples.

### Data Science & Machine Learning
Reduce dimensionality before classification or regression, explore feature relationships, visualize high-dimensional clusters, or compress data while preserving variance. Export transformed data for use in other ML pipelines.

### Education & Research
Teach multivariate statistics with interactive visualizations, explore research data with publication-ready plots, or demonstrate the power of dimensionality reduction with real examples.

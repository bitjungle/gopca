# GoPCA - The Definitive Principal Component Analysis Application

Professional-grade PCA analysis made simple. Available as both a powerful command-line tool and an intuitive desktop application.

## What is GoPCA?

GoPCA is **the** go-to application for Principal Component Analysis - a fundamental technique for understanding complex, multivariate data. Whether you're analyzing spectroscopic data, exploring gene expression patterns, or reducing dimensionality in machine learning pipelines, GoPCA provides the tools you need.

### Includes GoCSV Data Preparation Tool

GoPCA comes with **GoCSV**, a companion application for preparing your data. With its Excel-like interface, GoCSV makes it easy to clean, edit, and format your CSV files before PCA analysis - ensuring your data is analysis-ready.

## Three Powerful Tools

### The GoPCA Desktop Application

Perfect for interactive data exploration, method development, and teaching.

**Key Desktop Features:**
- Interactive visualizations with zoom, pan, and export
- Real-time plot updates as you adjust parameters
- Confidence ellipses for group visualization
- Customizable color palettes for different data types
- Light and dark themes for comfortable viewing

### The GoPCA Command-Line Interface

Ideal for automation, batch processing, and integration into data pipelines.

```bash
# Analyze your data with a single command
pca analyze --components 3 --scale standard --output-dir results/ data.csv

# Validate data before analysis
pca validate spectra.csv

# Apply a saved PCA model to new data
pca transform model.json new_data.csv

# Transform with output options
pca transform -f json -o results/ model.json new_samples.csv
```

### TheGoCSV Data Editor

Clean and prepare your data with an intuitive spreadsheet-like interface.

**GoCSV Features:**
- Edit cells directly like in Excel
- Add, remove, or reorder columns
- Multi-step undo/redo functionality
- Column type detection (numeric, categorical, target)
- Real-time validation against GoPCA requirements
- Missing value detection and handling
- Export clean CSV files ready for PCA analysis

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Analysis
- **Multiple algorithms**: 
  - SVD (default) - Fast and accurate for complete data

  - Kernel PCA - For non-linear relationships
- **Flexible preprocessing**: 
  - Mean centering and scaling
  - Robust scaling for outlier resistance
  - SNV (Standard Normal Variate) for spectroscopy
  - Vector normalization
- **Missing data strategies**: Drop, mean imputation, or iterative methods

### Professional Visualizations

2. **Launch** GoPCA Desktop
3. **Try an example** - Select "Wine" or "Iris" from the example datasets
4. **Or load your data** - Click "Open CSV" to load your own file
5. **Configure preprocessing** - Choose centering, scaling, and other options
6. **Click "Go PCA!"** - Explore results interactively

<!-- ![GoPCA Workflow](docs/images/workflow.png) -->
*[Screenshot placeholder: Step-by-step workflow visualization]*

### Data Preparation with GoCSV

1. **Launch** GoCSV from the GoPCA installation folder
2. **Open** your raw CSV file or paste data from clipboard
3. **Clean** your data:
   - Remove empty rows/columns
   - Fix inconsistent headers
   - Handle missing values
   - Validate column types
4. **Save** the cleaned file
5. **Open in GoPCA** with one click

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Download the latest release
wget https://github.com/bitjungle/gopca/releases/latest/download/pca
chmod +x pca

# Basic analysis with automatic settings
./pca analyze mydata.csv

# Advanced analysis with custom parameters
./pca analyze \
  --components 4 \
  --scale standard \
  --preprocessing snv \
  --format json \
  --output-dir results/ \
  mydata.csv

# Validate your data first
./pca validate mydata.csv

# Apply a trained model to new samples
./pca transform trained_model.json new_samples.csv

# Transform with custom output and metrics
./pca transform \
  --format json \
  --output-dir predictions/ \
  --include-metrics \
  model.json test_data.csv
```

## Use Cases

### Chemometrics & Spectroscopy
Analyze NIR, FTIR, Raman, or UV-Vis spectroscopic data to identify chemical patterns, detect adulterants, or monitor reactions. The SNV preprocessing option is specifically designed for spectroscopic data.

### Bioinformatics
Explore gene expression, proteomics, or metabolomics data to find biological patterns, identify biomarkers, or understand disease mechanisms. Handle high-dimensional data with thousands of variables.

### Quality Control & Process Monitoring
Monitor industrial processes in real-time, detect anomalies before they become problems, and understand the relationships between process variables. Use diagnostic plots to identify out-of-specification samples.

### Data Science & Machine Learning
Reduce dimensionality before classification or regression, explore feature relationships, visualize high-dimensional clusters, or compress data while preserving variance. Export transformed data for use in other ML pipelines.

### Education & Research
Teach multivariate statistics with interactive visualizations, explore research data with publication-ready plots, or demonstrate the power of dimensionality reduction with real examples.

## Example: Analyzing Wine Data

<!-- ![GoPCA Results Example](docs/images/results-example.png) -->
*[Screenshot placeholder: Split view showing CLI output and GUI visualization of wine dataset analysis]*

The included wine dataset demonstrates PCA's power in distinguishing wine types based on chemical composition. With just two principal components, you can clearly separate three wine varieties - showing how PCA reveals hidden patterns in complex data.

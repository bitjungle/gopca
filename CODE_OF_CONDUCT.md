# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the GoPCA community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* **Respecting the maintainer's vision and roadmap for this personal project**
* Understanding that this is a spare-time project with limited bandwidth

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

As this is a personal project maintained in spare time, enforcement will be on a best-effort basis. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer at devel@bitjungle.com. 

The project maintainer will review and investigate all complaints as time permits, and will respond in a way deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project maintainer is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
